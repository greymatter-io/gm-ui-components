## [0.7.1](https://github.com/DecipherNow/gm-ui-components/compare/v0.7.0...v0.7.1) (2018-10-29)

### Bug Fixes

- refactor LoadingSpinner ([#386](https://github.com/DecipherNow/gm-ui-components/issues/386)) ([82ff859](https://github.com/DecipherNow/gm-ui-components/commit/82ff859))

# [0.7.0](https://github.com/DecipherNow/gm-ui-components/compare/v0.6.1...v0.7.0) (2018-10-26)

### Breaking Changes

- The `Input` component is now `InputField`
- Checkbox, InputRange, Select, Radio, and Textarea are all separate components
- Icon display names have changed to reflect the component name. It's likely you will have to update your tests if you were making assertions on the old Icons using the displayName.
- Table accentColor prop has been deprecated. Use the new theming interface instead. Note: `brandColor` is the only theme variable exposed in 0.7.0.

```javascript
import { ThemeProvider } from "styled-components";

<ThemeProvider theme={{ brandColor: "blue" }}>
  <App />
</ThemeProvider>;
```
